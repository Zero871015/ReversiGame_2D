You can read this first: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zero871015/ReversiGame/master/README.md

## What I Add?
* brand new interface with 2D GUI.
  * Now, you can play with you mouse(not the thing your cat catch).
* Cool BGM when you play the game.
  * Actually, it from "Fortnite". Don't sue me PLZ.
* If you don't want to play, don't worry about it. Here is a Flip System for you!!!

## If you can't not open .exe
* Try to put the resourse folder at the same directory of the .exe.

### Enjoy It!
